## Description

The purpose of the project is to create a web-based lost and found system to help identify missing persons and unite them with their loved ones in Bangladesh. The project aims to provide a faster/more dynamic way to find missing persons rather than manual methods like police reports and advertising in the media. The technologies used for developing this system were `HTML`, `CSS`, `Bootstrap`, `PHP` and `MySql`.The author also plans to integrate `image recognition` to the system. The system is **user-friendly** and **fast**.

## Features

- A Home page which with Sign-up and Login options. On clicking the sing up/login option, they will be redirected to the sign up/login form where they provide the necessary information. A user profile is created after sign in.
- The users can report lost/found issue after login
- A search option for searching missing person(s). Seperate Search Categories for lost and found. Each category has `Normal` and `Advanced` search. Normal search is by providing only names. Advanced search is for providing `skin tone`, `age`, `when they went missing`
- The user is updated of the missing person(s) status via `email`.
