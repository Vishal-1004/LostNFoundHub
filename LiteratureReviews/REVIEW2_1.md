## Description

The purpose of this project is a Lost and Found Web Application for the locals in Malaysia.

Technologies used for developing this system were `ASP`, `HTML`, `CSS`, `JavaScript`, `PHP`, `XAMPP`, `XML`, `Apache HTTP Server` and `MySql`. The author emphasized on the importance of a **simple** and **user-friendly** user interface.The author of this article divided the entire project in 2 different phases to complete their project.

## Features

The system provided features like:

- A Home page which displays sign in/up options
- A search option to search for lost/found items based on item's `category`,`colour`,`location`,`lost or found status`.There is an advanced search option where the user can specify the `no of days` from which they want to see the results.
- Seperate Search Categories for lost and found.
- The Lost/Found Originator is updated via `email` about the status of the item(s) they have lost/found.
